USAGE: toprores [OPTION]

Converts video files in the current directory to the ProRes format using ffmpeg.
If run without options, it converts all video files in the current directory.
It can also take a specific file name or a file extension as an option.

Options:
  - If no argument is provided, the function will search for and convert all
    video files (.mp4, .mkv, .avi, .mov) in the current directory to ProRes
    format.
  
  - If a file name is provided as the first argument (e.g., video.mp4), the
    function will convert that specific file to ProRes format.
  
  - If a file extension is provided as the first argument (e.g., mp4),
    the function will convert all files with that extension in the current
    directory to ProRes format.

Notes:
  - The first time you run the function, it will ask for the name of the
    output directory where the converted ProRes videos will be stored.
    This name will be saved in the ~/.toprores config file for future use.
  
  - The output directory will be created in the current directory if it
    doesn't already exist.
